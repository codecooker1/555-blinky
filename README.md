# 555-blinky
555 LED Chaser board made with a 555 Timer as the clock. Made possible with hackclub blueprint.

I made this blinky board following the [linky starter project](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/starter-projects/blinky) 
While I have quite some experience with software but this is my first ever hardware project. 

If you have any suggestion or any advice feel free to open an issue.
